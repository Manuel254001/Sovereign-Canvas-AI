`# Sovereign Canvas AI`

## Overview

Sovereign Canvas AI is a lightweight, AI-powered mini-app designed to run within a creator's LUKSO Universal Profile on The Grid. It transforms static digital identities into dynamic, personalized showcases of LSP-based assets (art, music, collectibles, writing, etc.), enabling decentralized monetization and deep identity-aware engagement.

Built on the principles of digital self-sovereignty, this project aims to break the creator economy free from platform constraints, empowering creators to fully own, display, and monetize their work—directly from their Universal Profiles.

## Features

### ✨ AI-Powered Curation: A smart client-side module organizes and personalizes asset display based on metadata.

### 💼 LSP Integration: Fetches and displays LSP4 metadata and LSP8 digital assets from the creator's Universal Profile.

### 🌎 Self-Sovereign Identity: Runs entirely within the LUKSO ecosystem using @lukso/up-provider and The Grid.

### ✨ Token-Gated Access: Placeholder logic for checking LSP7 token balances for unlocking exclusive content.

### 💸 Monetization Ready: Buy/Unlock placeholders simulate LSP8 sales and fan support.

### 📆 Grid Simulation: Tailwind-powered layout visually mimics The Grid's layout system.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Node.js (v18 or newer)

Yarn or npm

# Installation
## Install dependencies
$ yarn install

# Start the development server
$ yarn dev

# # Usage

Connect your Universal Profile using the LUKSO browser extension.

The mini-app will fetch mock assets (replaceable with real smart contract queries).

AI logic sorts assets by type or dummy popularity.

Interact with the placeholders for purchase or unlocking gated content.
